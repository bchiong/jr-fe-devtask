Welcome to the World Nomads Group - Jnr. Front End Dev. Exercise.

The purpose of this exercise is to help us get an idea of your web development knowledge and approach.

_There is no score card for this exercise. You can do as much or as little as you choose. We recommend a few hours, though it's really up to you._

## Instructions

We've created this lovely new website for World Nomads Group. Unfortunately because of time constraints we did it in a rush. As such we've introduced a range of bugs, errors and general poor coding practices.

Your task is to help us fix these bugs, resolve any errors and tidy up some of our sloppy code :D

A few things to keep an eye out for:

1. The html is not very semantic.
2. Our headings aren't responsive. They should adjust based on screen sizes.
3. There are a number of bugs and errors.
4. Best practice for css and js resources wasn't followed.

## Bonus points for the hard-core

1. Concatenate and minify our JS and CSS resources. You could do this with Gulp.
2. Improve the CSS by implementing a modular CSS methodology.

## Development tips

The simplest thing you can to get started is download or clone this repository, then start editing the files.

If you would like to make things easier for yourself, you can run Gulp to help automate some tasks. You'll need to [install node and npm](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) first.

From your terminal/shell:

1. `git clone git@github.com:edwardhatricksmith/jr-fe-devtask.git`
2. `cd jr-fe-devtask`
3. `npm install`
4. `gulp`

## Submitting your work

Submit your work by attaching it to your job application by either:

- pushing the branch to your own repo.
- attaching a zip file
- using Dropbox or something along those lines

_Don't push to this jr-fe-devtask repo. It's not private so others will be able to see your work._
